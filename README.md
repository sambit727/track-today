# track-today
This is a simple diary app - click on the calendar dates to store diary entries. Entries will be stored in a local database on your hard drive, others will not be able to see it. App is still in testing stage, do not rely on it.

**INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Download and unzip the folder
2. Open 'Diary App' folder
3. Run TrackToday.exe (should be a shortcut)

Since TrackToday.exe is a shortcut to the main file, you can locate it anywhere e.g. on your Desktop

Please feel free to suggest changes, report bugs, or even ideas for other features. My gf just recommended me to allow for customizable colour schemes so I'll be trying that next. Thank you :)
